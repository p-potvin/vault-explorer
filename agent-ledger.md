- **Goal:** Secure the application against shell command injection vulnerabilities.
- **Decision:** Replaced all instances of `child_process.exec` in `main.js` with `child_process.execFile`.
- **Context:** The `exec` function spawns a shell, which interprets shell metacharacters. If unvalidated file paths are interpolated into the string command, they could be crafted to execute arbitrary commands. Using `execFile` passes arguments safely in an array directly to the executable, avoiding the shell interpreter entirely.
- **Affected Components:** `get-everything-size` IPC handler and `ffmpeg` queue execution (`generate-webm` handler, `processFfmpegQueue`, and `runPreviewFfmpeg`).

- **Goal:** Improve UX and accessibility for empty states.
- **Decision:** Added context-aware Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons ("Browse Vault" or "Clear Filters") and `aria-hidden="true"` attributes to decorative SVGs in the empty states.
- **Context:** Empty states previously only provided textual guidance which required users to hunt for the correct UI element (e.g., the toolbar button). Placing direct, actionable buttons contextually improves usability. Additionally, decorative images like the empty state SVGs should explicitly be hidden from screen readers to reduce noise.
- **Affected Components:** `index.html` static empty state, and dynamic empty state generation within the `applyFilters` JavaScript function.
